New Term: Massive-Particle
Action: Addition
Label: Massive Particle
Description: A subatomic particle with rest mass or a small accumulation
  of these (e.g., atoms, ions), but still small enough that quantum
  effects matter.
Relationships: Wider than #Neutrino (i.e., #Neutrino will become a child
  of this once it is accepted).
Used-in: The registry record of ivo://org.gavo.dc/uhecr/q/cone

Rationale: 
  The proposed concept tries to include any astrophysical messenger that
  will reasonably register in radiation detectors but is not a
  photon.  We want to exclude things like dust, as that in general
  requires very different techniques in measurement and data use.
  However, as written here, the concept would presumably include
  molecules measured in in-situ experiments.  In that sense, a chemical
  profile of an atmosphere obtained by a planetary probe would use this
  concept as well as, potentially, and exobiology experiment looking for
  proteins.  It is not entirely clear to the author whether such
  messengers – which again require techniques very much different from
  cosmic ray observatories – should share a concept with the messengers
  used in astroparticle physics; this should be considered in the
  discussion of the proposed concept.
